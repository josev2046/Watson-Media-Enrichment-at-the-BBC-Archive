1
00:00:00.555 --> 00:00:04.055
The BBC managing an enormous archive used Watson

2
00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.735
to improve its metadata

3
00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.055
and made content retrieval more intuitive.

4
00:00:09.125 --> 00:00:10.975
This project harnessed AI,

5
00:00:11.175 --> 00:00:13.895
particularly advanced natural language understanding

6
00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:15.935
to analyze and interpret content.

7
00:00:16.845 --> 00:00:20.215
This allowed users to ask questions in plain English

8
00:00:20.475 --> 00:00:23.895
and get back relevant information, fundamentally changing

9
00:00:24.035 --> 00:00:25.495
how the archive was accessed

10
00:00:25.495 --> 00:00:28.375
and used With media collections growing

11
00:00:28.475 --> 00:00:29.615
at an incredible rate.

12
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:33.015
Effective tools for searching, discovering,

13
00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:35.495
and accessing content were absolutely vital.

14
00:00:36.835 --> 00:00:39.735
The Blue Room, the BBC's Innovation Hub,

15
00:00:40.205 --> 00:00:43.655
implemented my architecture, an early rag prototype,

16
00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:47.295
focusing on NLU to unlock the potential

17
00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:48.335
of its video archive.

18
00:00:49.195 --> 00:00:51.135
The aim of this initiative was to move

19
00:00:51.135 --> 00:00:53.695
beyond traditional ways of tagging content

20
00:00:54.035 --> 00:00:57.175
and enabled dynamic human-like interaction

21
00:00:57.525 --> 00:00:58.775
with archived material.

22
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:01.975
Our main goals for this project were clear

23
00:01:02.515 --> 00:01:04.055
to enhance the searchability

24
00:01:04.435 --> 00:01:07.855
and accessibility to allow users to retrieve

25
00:01:08.455 --> 00:01:11.455
relevant information by asking questions in plain English,

26
00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:15.095
to automate the enrichment of metadata, to improve

27
00:01:15.315 --> 00:01:16.455
how content is found.

28
00:01:17.035 --> 00:01:21.175
To demonstrate the practical application of AI in managing

29
00:01:21.395 --> 00:01:23.735
and making the most of large media archives

30
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:27.015
to improve content discovery for researchers

31
00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:30.095
and journalists, the project included several key steps.

32
00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:33.095
Assets were brought into the IBM platform.

33
00:01:33.715 --> 00:01:35.135
Watson analyzed video

34
00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:38.375
and audio content to detect scenes keywords,

35
00:01:38.565 --> 00:01:39.975
objects, and emotions.

36
00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:43.575
NLU was used to extract not just metadata,

37
00:01:43.635 --> 00:01:46.815
but also concepts, entities, and themes from the content.

38
00:01:47.645 --> 00:01:49.375
This crucial step allowed the system

39
00:01:49.395 --> 00:01:52.815
to understand the context of plain English queries

40
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.895
and then retrieve the most relevant sections of the archive.

41
00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:58.775
Watson identified the main emotions

42
00:01:58.775 --> 00:01:59.815
present within the video.

43
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:02.775
Audio was transcribed into text.

44
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.415
For analysis, objects, faces,

45
00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:08.375
and scenes were automatically recognized and tagged.

46
00:02:09.195 --> 00:02:11.175
The Watson API was used

47
00:02:11.175 --> 00:02:13.655
to create searchable JSON metadata objects.

48
00:02:14.475 --> 00:02:16.575
The project delivered significant outcomes,

49
00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:21.335
enhanced metadata for archived video content leading

50
00:02:21.435 --> 00:02:23.775
to more precise and intuitive searches.

51
00:02:24.635 --> 00:02:26.695
The ability to retrieve relevant content

52
00:02:27.155 --> 00:02:30.455
by asking questions in plain English greatly improving

53
00:02:30.455 --> 00:02:31.535
the user experience.

54
00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:33.735
The automated creation

55
00:02:33.735 --> 00:02:37.215
of playlists based on complex natural language queries

56
00:02:37.805 --> 00:02:40.695
increased efficiency in content discovery

57
00:02:40.835 --> 00:02:42.575
for researchers and journalists.

58
00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:47.655
A clear demonstration of AI's potential, especially NLU

59
00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:49.535
for Dynamic Archive Management.

60
00:02:50.495 --> 00:02:54.175
A demo walkthrough using a NEWSNIGHT sample on the signing

61
00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:56.375
of the Good Friday agreement was used

62
00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:58.255
to illustrate these results. In practice,

63
00:02:59.005 --> 00:03:02.485
Implementing Watson with its strong focus on NLU

64
00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.685
directly address the challenge of managing a truly massive

65
00:03:05.795 --> 00:03:08.605
archive by automating metadata, enrichment

66
00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:10.605
and enabling intuitive queries.

67
00:03:11.235 --> 00:03:13.045
This significantly reduced the time

68
00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:15.045
and cost involved in finding content.

69
00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:19.605
By allowing users to interact with the archive in a natural,

70
00:03:19.745 --> 00:03:22.805
conversational way, the system transformed

71
00:03:23.115 --> 00:03:26.165
what were previously static videotapes into dynamic

72
00:03:26.585 --> 00:03:27.925
useful knowledge resources.

73
00:03:28.395 --> 00:03:30.605
Looking ahead, our plans included

74
00:03:31.435 --> 00:03:35.725
exploring further applications of NLU in archive management,

75
00:03:36.475 --> 00:03:40.325
integrating Watson with other BBC systems continuing

76
00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:43.005
to improve natural language processing capabilities,

77
00:03:43.825 --> 00:03:45.405
and expanding the use of the system

78
00:03:45.505 --> 00:03:47.925
to other archive materials beyond just video.

79
00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:51.485
This project clearly showed the transformative potential

80
00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:54.445
of NLU in media archive management.

81
00:03:55.225 --> 00:03:59.485
It demonstrated how AI can enable intuitive human-like

82
00:03:59.515 --> 00:04:02.925
interaction with archived content, moving well

83
00:04:02.925 --> 00:04:04.365
beyond traditional search methods.

84
00:04:05.305 --> 00:04:07.245
By presenting the BBC's experience,

85
00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:11.005
it offered a valuable example for other institutions seeking

86
00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:14.325
to improve their archive accessibility and usability.

87
00:04:15.395 --> 00:04:16.605
Hope you find it interesting.
